# Card Games

A self-determined solo 1-day project made during the JavaScript module of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course to design an app using JavaScript / React and the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/). 

The current version of the app contains a single card game based on the "52 card pick-up" idea. The app has been designed in a way to ensure it is fairly adaptable to being expanded for further card games at a later date.

A [live copy of this app](https://louise3112.github.io/card_games/) is available via github pages.


## Getting Started
These instructions should get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes:

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the app:
```
npm start
```

The web applicaiton can then be viewed in the browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000/card_games.
